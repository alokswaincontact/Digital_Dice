	Problem: A set of N buses are distributed to arrive within a one hour
	window. One arrival is set to the end of the hour, the other N-1 arrive at
	random, uniformly distributed arrival times with the hour.  If a rider
	also arrives at a random, uniformly distributed time within the hour, what
	is average wait time for a bus to arrive?
